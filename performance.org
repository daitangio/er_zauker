To test performance, use the perf_monitor.sh to regiter data in an independent way.


* Performance v0.0.3
Using hipe, 64 bit and compiling only er_zauker_util as native (default configuration)
we can reach 300  parallel connections to redis and 4 files per second.

On already indexed files (When we are just checking md5) performance are a lot higher.

| Files processed | Files/Sec | Scope                                     |
|             772 |     3.197 | All new                                   |
|            1002 |     3.940 | All new                                   |
|            1002 |    40.420 | All already indexed                       |
|                 |           | Mixed scenario: 1002 file already indexed |
|                 |           |                                           |
