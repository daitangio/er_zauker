* How to develop: suggested installation
** On Linux (Debian)
Erlang R17 is needed. We strongly suggest Hipe (native compiler) on a 64bit installation
Install Erlang Hipe and dev libs (use "aptitude versions" to get the complete list).
For instance: 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
 aptitude install erlang-base-hipe=1:17.1-dfsg-1  erlang-dev=1:17.1-dfsg-1 erlang-eunit=1:17.1-dfsg-1
#+END_SRC
